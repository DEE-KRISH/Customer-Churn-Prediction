# Bank Customer Churn Analysis with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview

This Python mini-project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a banking context using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical issue for banks, and predicting which customers are likely to churn can help in implementing proactive strategies to retain them.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load and preprocess customer data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize key metrics and patterns using various charts and graphs.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features that may help in predicting customer churn.
- **KNN Model Building:** Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict customer churn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the KNN model using appropriate metrics.
- **Results Interpretation:** Interpret the results and provide actionable insights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
